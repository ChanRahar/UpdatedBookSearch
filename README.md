# Google-Book-Search

This React application uses the Google Books API to search any books. User can create an account, and save search books that the user can view them at later time. Once a book is saved, the user has the option to delete the saved book.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm i
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm i
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:8800>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
